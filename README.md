# 📌 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 🔍 Project Title & Short Description
**COVID-19 Global Data Tracker**  
This project analyzes COVID-19 global trends using real-world data from *Our World in Data (OWID)*. It covers confirmed cases, deaths, vaccination progress, and key health indicators for selected countries — Kenya, India, and the USA — and visualizes global trends using charts and maps.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project
- Clean and process real-world pandemic data using Python and pandas.
- Explore COVID-19 trends for Kenya, India, and the United States.
- Visualize:
  - Total cases and deaths over time.
  - Daily new cases comparisons.
  - Vaccination rollouts and population coverage.
  - Global distributions using choropleth maps.
- Derive insights into country-level and global patterns.

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – plotting graphs
- **Plotly Express** – interactive choropleth maps
- **NumPy** – numerical operations

## ▶️ How to Run / View the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `python-final-project.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Ensure the OWID COVID-19 dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) is available in the same directory or adjust the file path in the notebook.
4. Run each cell sequentially to:
   - Load, clean, and explore the data.
   - Generate visualizations and insights.

## 📈 Insights & Reflections
- **The U.S. had the highest total deaths**, while **India had the most cases**.
- **Kenya had the slowest vaccine rollout**, with under 20% full vaccination.
- **Death rates** varied across countries, possibly due to reporting and healthcare differences.
- **Vaccination coverage** on the world map clearly favored high-income countries.
- The project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning and filtering in real-world datasets.
